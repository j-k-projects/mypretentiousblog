Combining this Cavalier with Deep Neural Networks always proves fruitful.   
  
Pip was born in 2017, and her value is, has been, and continues to be immeasurable. 

Gatys et al. published “A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style” in 2015, and “Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks” 2016. These seminal works led to the explosion of Convolutional Neural Networks and the ubiquitous spread of Neural Style Transfer. 

Roy Lichtenstein’s produced “Drowning Girl” in 1963. The iconic painting is still pretty dang cool to this day.   
  
  
**Pip (2020)**

A nice sunny day provided a well-lit front room that was suitable for a portrait of Pip.

**Drowning Girl (1963)**

An awesome painting from an iconic artist. Drowning Girl can be seen at the Museum of Modern Art.

**Neural Style Transfer - Pip and Drowning Girl**

A Convolutional Neural Network is the underlying voodoo powering this fantastic mashup.

And the result speaks for itself.
